## Getting Started
1. Chat with Q to get some ideas

> I am participating Amazon Q cli event, where we are trying to develop a game using Amazon Q and PyGame. I do not have experience in PyGame Framework but I have AWS experience. Let's start by picking concept of game. I want this game to be simple to make (around 2-4 hour development time) and good introduction to PyGame framework and game development. Suggest a good starting point and good ganre to make with PyGame
I'd be happy to help you develop a simple game using PyGame! Given your constraints (2-4 hour development time) and being new to PyGame, let's focus on something achievable yet
educational.

## Game Concept Suggestions

For beginners to PyGame, these genres work particularly well:

1. Arcade-style games - Simple mechanics, clear objectives
2. Puzzle games - Focus on logic rather than complex graphics
3. Simple platformers - Basic movement and collision detection

My recommendation would be a Space Shooter game for these reasons:
• Classic arcade style with straightforward mechanics
• Covers fundamental PyGame concepts (sprites, collision, input handling)
• Visually rewarding even with simple graphics
• Easily expandable if you want to add features later
• Perfect for a 2-4 hour development window

## Starting Point

Here's how we can approach this:

1. Setup PyGame environment
2. Create a basic game window
3. Add player ship with movement controls
4. Implement enemies and basic shooting mechanics
5. Add collision detection and scoring
6. Polish with simple sounds and visual effects

Let's start by checking if you have PyGame installed and setting up our project structure:


🛠️  Using tool: execute_bash
 ⋮
 ● I will run the following shell command:
mkdir -p space_shooter && cd space_shooter && python3 -m pip install pygame --user 2>&1 || echo "Failed to install pygame"
 ⋮
 ↳ Purpose: Creating project directory and installing PyGame


Allow this action? Use 't' to trust (always allow) this tool for the session. [y/n/t]:

> Let's do something other than space shooter. I think its bit too common. Let's do something similar to Pikachu Volleyball. Where there is a ball and player. and player's goal is to keep the ball away from touching the ground. To make things interesting, there will be obstacles flying towards to ball and upon collison, it will changes ball's trajectory. Maybe we can have some items to make player faster, duplicate balls, give ball temporary flying ability, moving ball slower etc.
That's a fantastic and creative idea! A Pikachu Volleyball-inspired game with obstacles and power-ups sounds both fun and achievable within your 2-4 hour timeframe. It's also a great way
to learn PyGame fundamentals while creating something more unique than a space shooter.

Let's outline this volleyball-style game:

## Game Concept: Bounce Master

Core Mechanics:
• Player controls a paddle/character at the bottom of the screen
• Ball bounces around the screen
• Player must prevent the ball from touching the ground
• Obstacles fly across the screen that can alter the ball's trajectory
• Power-ups appear randomly to help the player

Power-ups:
• Speed boost: Makes the player move faster temporarily
• Ball slowdown: Reduces ball speed temporarily
• Multi-ball: Creates duplicate balls
• Anti-gravity: Ball hovers instead of falling for a few seconds
• Paddle size increase: Makes your paddle larger temporarily

## Development Plan

1. Setup the game window and basic physics
2. Create the player paddle with movement controls
3. Implement the ball with bouncing physics
4. Add collision detection between ball, paddle, and screen edges
5. Create obstacles that fly across the screen
6. Implement power-ups and their effects
7. Add scoring system and game over conditions
8. Polish with simple sounds and visual effects

Would you like me to help you start setting up this game? I can create the initial structure and basic game elements to get you going.
Great! Let's start building our Bounce Master game. I'll help you set up the initial structure and implement the basic game elements.

First, let's create a project directory and install PyGame:


🛠️  Using tool: execute_bash
 ⋮
 ● I will run the following shell command:
mkdir -p bounce_master && cd bounce_master && python3 -m pip install pygame --user 2>&1 || echo "Failed to install pygame"
 ⋮
